# üîê Cipher Yield Share

> **Next-Generation Privacy-Preserving DeFi Platform**

Transform your real-world asset investments into confidential, encrypted yield streams using cutting-edge Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology.

## ‚ú® What Makes Us Different

Unlike traditional DeFi platforms that expose your financial data, Cipher Yield Share leverages **Zama's FHEVM** to ensure your investment amounts, yield rates, and portfolio allocations remain completely private until distribution.

### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy-First Architecture

- **Zero-Knowledge Yield Positions**: Create positions without revealing underlying amounts
- **Encrypted Share Distribution**: Share yields with mathematical privacy guarantees  
- **Confidential Analytics**: View performance metrics without exposing sensitive data
- **FHE-Native Smart Contracts**: All computations happen on encrypted data

### üöÄ Advanced Features

- **Multi-Asset Support**: Real estate, infrastructure, commodities, and more
- **Dynamic Yield Calculation**: FHE-encrypted yield computation and distribution
- **Reputation System**: Privacy-preserving user and platform reputation tracking
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Built for Ethereum with future multi-chain support

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Stack

| **Frontend** | React 18 + TypeScript | Modern, type-safe UI |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Beautiful, responsive design |
| **Web3** | Wagmi + Rainbow Kit | Seamless wallet integration |
| **Blockchain** | Ethereum Sepolia | Testnet deployment |
| **Encryption** | Zama FHEVM | Fully homomorphic encryption |
| **Build Tool** | Vite | Fast development and builds |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ 
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Git**

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BitLover0x/cipher-yield-share.git
cd cipher-yield-share

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment configuration
cp env.example .env

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup

Configure your `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY

# Wallet Connect
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Contract Addresses (set after deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERIFIER_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## üìã Smart Contract Features

Our Solidity contract (`contracts/CipherYieldShare.sol`) implements:

### Core Functions
- **`createYieldPosition()`**: Create FHE-encrypted yield positions
- **`createYieldShare()`**: Distribute shares with encrypted amounts
- **`distributeYield()`**: Distribute yields while maintaining privacy
- **`verifyPosition()`**: Platform verification system
- **`updateReputation()`**: Privacy-preserving reputation tracking

### Security Features
- **FHE Data Types**: All sensitive data uses `euint32` encryption
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for operations
- **Audit Trail**: Encrypted event logging
- **Fee Management**: Configurable platform fees
